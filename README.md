## Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Create Resource Allocation**
   - Contributor creates allocation with recipient and stages
   - Funds are escrowed in the contract
   - Project timer begins

2. **Track Progress**
   - Recipient reports stage progress
   - Evidence and details recorded on-chain
   - Administrator validates completed stages

3. **Release Funds**
   - Administrator approves completed stages
   - Funds released proportionally
   - Process repeats until completion

4. **Handle Completion/Expiration**
   - Successful completion: All funds released
   - Expiration: Remaining funds refunded
   - Cancellation: Proportional refund issued

### Quick Start Example

```clarity
;; 1. Create a 3-stage project allocation
(contract-call? .decentralized-funding launch-resource-allocation
  'SP1EXAMPLE...RECIPIENT
  u1000000  ;; 1 STX in microSTX
  (list u1 u2 u3))  ;; Three project stages

;; 2. Report progress (as recipient)
(contract-call? .decentralized-funding report-stage-progress
  u1        ;; resource-id
  u0        ;; stage-index
  u100      ;; 100% complete
  "Stage 1: MVP development completed"
  0x1234...)  ;; evidence hash

;; 3. Validate stage (as administrator)
(contract-call? .decentralized-funding validate-project-stage u1)
```

(contract-call? .decentralized-funding launch-resource-allocation
  'SP2DEVELOPER...ADDRESS
  u2000000  ;; 2 STX
  (list u1 u2))

;; Developer reports completion of stage 1
(contract-call? .decentralized-funding report-stage-progress
  u1 u0 u100
  "Frontend implementation completed"
  0xabc123...)

;; Administrator validates and releases 50% of funds
(contract-call? .decentralized-funding validate-project-stage u1)
```

### Example 2: Multi-Recipient Split

```clarity
;; Split funding between frontend and backend developers
(contract-call? .decentralized-funding create-split-resource-allocation
  (list 
    { recipient: 'SP1FRONTEND...DEV, allocation-percentage: u60 }
    { recipient: 'SP2BACKEND...DEV, allocation-percentage: u40 })
  u5000000)  ;; 5 STX total
```

### Example 3: Emergency Recovery

```clarity
;; Contributor initiates emergency recovery
(contract-call? .decentralized-funding emergency-allocation-recovery
  u1
  "Recipient unresponsive for 30+ days")

;; Administrator approves recovery
(contract-call? .decentralized-funding emergency-allocation-recovery
  u1
  "Confirmed - recipient account compromised")
```

### Example 4: Project Extension

```clarity
;; Extend project deadline by 3 days
(contract-call? .decentralized-funding extend-resource-allocation-duration
  u1
  u432)  ;; ~3 days in blocks

;; Add additional funding
(contract-call? .decentralized-funding increase-resource-allocation-amount

## Security Considerations

### Known Limitations

1. **Administrator Trust**: System requires trusted administrator for stage validation
2. **Rate Limiting**: Per-contributor limits may not prevent coordinated attacks
3. **Emergency Recovery**: Requires cooperation between administrator and contributor

### Best Practices

1. **Multi-Signature**: Consider multi-sig for administrator functions
2. **Monitoring**: Implement off-chain monitoring for unusual activity
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with small allocations to test system behavior
4. **Regular Audits**: Periodic security reviews recommended
